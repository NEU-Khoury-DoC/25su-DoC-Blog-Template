# Best Life App Development Blog

Best Life is a web app developed in Leuven, Belgium by four Northeastern University students on a Dialogue of Civilizations focused on data and software in international government and politics. It provides insight in Europeon Union member states on how a user can improve their own or others' quality of life based on a set of priorities. This blog provides an overview of our app development process and details each team member's contributions to this project.
