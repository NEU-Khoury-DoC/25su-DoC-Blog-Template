## Blog post
So far, my time in Belgium has been incredibly exciting and educational. The city we are staying in, Leuven, is wonderful, as the architecture is historically rich. Moreover, the culture and atmosphere around the city are unlike any other I have seen. The food and drinks scene is incredible and extremely affordable. Combined with the sunny and not gloomy weather that's been around this week, every meal has been picture-perfect. Brussels, Bruges, and Oostende had very similar vibes. All three of which I had the opportunity to visit in the past week. 

I have also been given the gracious opportunity to tour the EU Parliament as well as talking to three people who work at NATO. The perspective given to me at these incredible events has given me plenty to think about, but my main takeaway is that I am terribly interested in working in NATO. The cybersecurity team there, by the looks of it, it is still relatively new and in a similar situation to my coop at MassDOT, just on a significantly bigger scale.


For the project, this phase, I, along with my team, found interesting datasets on asylum seekers, drafted/formed/wrote the question, and formed the persona questions. I also wrote all the user stories for the second persona (The EU Diplomat)
