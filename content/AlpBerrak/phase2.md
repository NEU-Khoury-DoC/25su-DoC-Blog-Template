### Phase 1 fixes
Upon recieving feedback for phase 1, my group had a decent amount of fixes to make. To start, we needed to change the user stories for the first and third user (Asylum Seeker and Lawyer) so they fit the proper criteria of a user story as well as giving a name to all three user personas. I also went in and cleaned up all the dates in the blogs so they no longer said 2024. I also went and added all four team memebers to the authors of the team blog.

### Phase 2 deliverables

#### ERD
Created the ERD diagram with Elianne. A majority of my effort was on getting the Lawyer ER diagram and then working to fix the others by making the diagrams readable and adding cardinality and participation. Afterwards, we created the Relational Diagram.

#### SQL
I then went and used the relational diagram to create the SQL tables. I had to take time to think about how to properly display attributes as the right datatype. Afterwards, I went in an created at least two INSERTs for every single entity. This was done to ensure that we had a table that actually works. I then proceed to send the SQL file to my teammate who double checked my work. I also then copied the url to the raw sql file to add as a link to the phase 2 team blog post!

#### Other
I went through with a photoshop adjacent tool to create a logo for our app OpenPort

### Other
The most notable experience of my phase 2 outside of the incredible deliverables I worked on was a trip I took on a free day to the world famous (and F1 grade) race track Circuit de Spa-Francochamps in the southern region of Belgium. I went to attend the spa classic and it was truly an exprience to remember as I saw classic touring and endurance cars racing around from just a few feet from the actual track, including one of my personal favorites, the Ford GT. I even managed to snag a grid walk pass and I was able to walk on the track itself before one of the races. It was a relativly cheap and exciting event that I would highly recommend.
