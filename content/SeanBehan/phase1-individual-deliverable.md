# Phase One Contributions
For phase one of the project my portion was creating three different user personas. This includes creating a story for each of them by giving a brief synopsis of their life, their goals and frustrations. I also created 4 user stories for each of the 3 users that specifies what each of the users will use the generated road safety score for. I also found a website on EuroStat that has Road traffic deaths, by type of roads which divides the data depending on the type of road.

# Interesting Aspects of the Dialogue for Week One
In terms of things that I found interesting during my first week on the dialogue was how the European institutions like NATO and E.U. Parliament was portrayed by the speakers in comparison to how the public perceives these institutions. Despite the severity of involvement these institutions have, it seems that the common European does not completely understand how these institutions run. I feel like this is directly parallel within the United states, as the majority of the people in the U.S. do not understand how state government, federal government, congress, etc work. This parallelity, to me, is very interesting as the speakers aim to emphasize its importance to those who are curious and take the time to visit the visitor programs they have but the general public (for both the U.S. and Europe) seems to be somewhat unaware of what is going on behind the scenes.
