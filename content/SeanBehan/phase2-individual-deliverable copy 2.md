# Phase Two Contributions

For Phase Two of the project, I was responsible for revising all the user personas and updating the original problem statement and project description. Each persona has now been aligned with our updated app concept, which focuses on European tourism statistics. In addition to reworking Phase One materials, I designed wireframes for both the personas and the home page. Collaborating with Aidan, we developed the ER diagrams for each persona as well as for the global dataset, and translated those into an initial MySQL DDL model. I also updated the Phase Two team blog with the wireframes, the interactive ER diagram, and a detailed recap of the changes made from Phase One.

# Interesting Aspects of the Dialogue for Week Two

By week two and a half of the Dialogue, I finally feel adjusted to being in Belgium. During the first week, everything felt like it was moving at lightning speed with back-to-back visits to EU institutions and the rapid pace of learning new material in class. But after this most recent weekend, I’ve started to feel grounded and have a clearer sense of what to expect from this Dialogue.

I’ve gotten to know my way around Leuven, especially through running, and I now have a pretty good sense of where to find the most affordable food spots. While I could easily spend five weeks just exploring Belgium, I also want to make the most of this experience academically. I genuinely value the challenges I’ve faced in my courses so far.

Phase Two, for example, felt unclear at first I wasn’t confident in a lot of areas. But through the struggle, I not only figured out how to bridge those knowledge gaps, I also feel like I’ve truly retained what I learned. Overall, this Dialogue has been a rewarding experience, both socially and academically.
