This program has continute to be a personally valuble experience. I really enjoyed the group dinner with the professors and PA, I was able to get closer to not only the faculty but also my peers on this dialouge, and felt it was a very positive experience. I've also been overall enjoying my time in Belgium, exploring new places with new friends, and am looking forward to the future.
