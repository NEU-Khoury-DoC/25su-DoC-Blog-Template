# Phase III Individual Deliverable

For Phase III, my contributions were as follows
- Designing and writing the API routes 
- Updating the Global Data Models based on phase 2 feedback 
- Updating the SQL DDL based on phase 2 feedback 
- Creating SQL DDL for model input storage
- Creating mock MEP data for input into the database
- Adding data from the database to front end screens

This program has been wonderful overall. I really enjoyed this most recent luxembourg trip. I think the trip was the catalyst in strenghtnening a lot of the friendships I've made on this trip. Exploring the city with everyone was a blast. Thank you for everything!
