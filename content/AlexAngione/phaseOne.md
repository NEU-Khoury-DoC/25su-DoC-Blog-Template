# Phase I Individual Deliverable

I have thoroughly enjoyed this dialogue so far. I have always felt the importance of being educated reguarding the current state of the world, but I have never taken (or had) the opportunity to dive this deep into the European Union and politics across the Atlantic. Our first guest speaker, Dr. Petri, was an eye opening conversation. I am honestly surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did. While I had heard of the EU before, and knew vaguely what the it was, having it laid out succinctly in front of me was captivating. Our subsequent visits to the various EU institutions have given life to the complex system described to me. Each one provided substance that strengthened and expanded my understanding. I truly believe the knowledge I have gained so far, in only a fifth of this program, has made me a more globally minded person and elevated my knowledge of the world significantly.

In terms of the phase one deliverable, I helped ideate and come up with our project idea. I helped in writing the project description, helped come up with the professions of our three personas, and I wrote most of the user stories for the "Yanni Polous" persona. I also verifed both of our data sources, and wrote the brief descriptions of both of them.
