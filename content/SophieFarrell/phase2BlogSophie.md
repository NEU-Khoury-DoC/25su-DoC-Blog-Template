## Time In Belgium


## Project Phase 2
I worked on the wireframes. I created each wireframe that we made for all 3 users, as well as the home page. I looked at the user stories and decided how that would best be translated into screens. I looked through the Streamlit documentation in order to make use of the components that I thought would suit each screen the best. I also worked on updating our user personas. I worked together with my teammates to decide that some of our user stories didn't make complete sense, so we altered our user personas in order to create new user stories that would better suit our goals. An example of this is Eura Peon, who now is considering moving since that it didn't make sense that she cared about another country's parental leave policies beforehand. Additionally, I worked on changing the user stories. Eura Peon each got two new user stories and I worked with my group to come up with all of them. I also looked over the ER diagram after John made the local diagrams for the users. He made them while I had dinner with the professors, so I reviewed them afterwards and offered suggestions, as well as pointed out the lack of ML data in the diagrams. I also reviewed the rest of the diagrams made based on these. After that, I updated our Phase 1 blog so that it reflected the changes we talked about. I wrote the wireframes sections of our phase 2 blog describing the images and what their uses are. I added the pictures of the wireframes to our assets folder and put them on the blog. I also informed the rest of my group that all diagrams/visualizations needed descriptions and our reasoning. I created our phase 2 blog and it's formatting. Additionally, I helped my group members with some git so that we didn't make new branches or update in main every time we wanted to access and edit another group member's edits. Though, Mia's computer is having some issues with using git and just the command line in general, likely due to the major updates her laptop went through based on my minor research. I also wrote the updates section of our phase 2 blog where we described the things we changed from phase 1. This includes our updated user personas and user stories, as well as the new dataset we have added to our project.
