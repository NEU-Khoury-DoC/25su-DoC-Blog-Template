# Phase 2 Individual Deliverable

## Contributions

I wrote SQL DDL for multiple tables and transferred all of the data from the Python DataFrames into SQL INSERT INTO statements.
I wrote 8 API endpoints for tourism data, helped get the Recommendation model from the Jupyter Notebook into a regualar Python file and create an endpoint for it. Then I created the results end of the interactive front end. I also made small contributions to writing the group post.

## Favorite Part of the Week
My favorite part of the week was getting to see some of the natural beauty in Luxembourg. We went to a lake along the mountains and got to look out atop some castle walls that had great views. I really enjoyed my time in Luxembourg.
