# Phase 2 Individual Deliverable

## Contributions

I helped evaluate the feedback from the first week, determine the new direction we were taking our project, write new personas, and develop plans for the new machine learning models we will create. I cleaned the road spending and gdp data. I also helped a lot with cleaning the data for the number of passenger cars and the number of trips people took. I led the creation of all 3 local ER models, the global ER model, and the transition into a relational map diagram. I helped with the initial SQL DDL.
