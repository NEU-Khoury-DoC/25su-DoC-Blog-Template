# Phase 2 Blog Post
## My contributions to Phase 2 of the project and what I've learned during our second week

For phase 2, I updated the user stories for the journalist, Camila, and the citizen, Greg. I also created the wireframes for Camila. My main focus for this phase was creating our initial data visualization to show how aligneed an individual MEP is with their party. There were many hurdles faced in this process, especially since our APIs did not specifically have easily accessible data on all of an MEP's votes. After my group members were able to extract the data that I needed, I created the bar plot visualization. 

One of my favorite activities was the chocolate and pastry making workshop with Dr. Fontenot's friend, Arno! He was so nice, and the treats were delicious.
