# Phase 2 Blog Post
## Contributions

For phase 2, I updated the user stories for the journalist, Camila, and the citizen, Greg. I also created the wireframes for Camila. My main focus for this phase was creating our initial data visualization to show how aligneed an individual MEP is with their party. There were many hurdles faced in this process, especially since our APIs did not specifically have easily accessible data on all of an MEP's votes. After my group members were able to extract the data that I needed, I created the bar plot visualization. 

## Activities

I feel like I've lived 100 lives during this week alone with the amount of activities I've done! It's definitely been a busy time, but I love having all of these new experiences. I don't want to forget any part of this trip, so I'm documenting everything below.

First off, we visited the Atomium, which was built for the 1958 Brussels World Fair. The light show inside was so cool!

We also had the amazing opportunity to visit the European Commission â€” I thought the speakers there were especially engaging. Afterwards, we participated in a chocolate and pastry making workshop with Dr. Fontenot's friend, Arno. He was so nice, and the treats were delicious!

To celebrate my friend Sophie's birthday, we got waffles during lunch and ramen for dinner. I definitely want to try as many waffles as I can while I'm here in Belgium; they'll be missed when I go back home!

It's always easier getting to know people in a smaller setting, so I loved going out to the small group dinner with the professors. The pizza was delicious, and it was especially exciting for me since I got my first co-op offer when we were at dinner! It was really fun that everyone was there to celebrate.

We also went bowling, and I performed *horribly*. I still had fun with the group, though, despite the fact that most of my attempts ended up in the gutter.

Learning about the history of computers at the NAM-IP Computer Museum in Namur was fascinating. Afterwards, we went to a cute cafe and had delicious pancakes, and then we went to a board game cafe and played Avalam. That evening, a couple friends from home happened to be in Belgium, so they visited Leuven! It was so fun showing them around the city and all of our favorite spots.

Lastly, we visited Ghent and participated in an Augmented Reality experience at St Bavo's Cathedral. I thought the animation was done *so* well, and the church itself has the most incredible architecture. We also visited the Castle of the Counts, and the views from the top were gorgeous.

In terms of academics, I've found it interesting learning about machine learning; the capabilities of ML models are rather impressive. This week, we also had a guest speaker discuss the ethics of the models, which I think is such an important conversation to have. The data itself is the foundation of any data science project, so it is critical to consider ethicalities when it comes to data collection and usage. This also opened up a class dialogue about implementing ethics education into our curriculums. As a STEM major, I feel that most of my coursework has been focused on developing technical skills, but being a well-rounded technician is not just about having the hard skills. Having these discussions at the start of our professional careers is vital to ensure that we understand the real-world implications of our work and contribute meaningfully to our industries. 

All in all, this has been an exciting week for both academics and experiences beyond the classroom. I cannot wait to see what's in store for us next week, especially as we head to Luxembourg!
