# Phase 1 Blog Post
## My contributions to Phase 1 of the project and what I've learned during our first week

For Phase 1, I helped my group come up with the idea for the machine learning model and created the citizen’s user stories. I also wrote persona descriptions and backgrounds for the party leader and citizen and part of the project description.

Even though we’ve only been here for a week, I’ve loved how much I’ve been able to explore and get to know everyone! It’s also great to get to know our professors on a more personal level, especially when we go out for meals with them. 

In terms of academics, learning about the European Union has been fascinating to me. I thought the first speaker, Dr Franzsika Petri, gave us an excellent foundation about the structure and functions of the EU. This allowed us to make the most of our visits to the EU Parliament and Commission.

I’ve also loved having the opportunity to explore different places in Belgium. We have visited Brussels as a group a few times, and I also visited Bruges during one of our free days. I LOVED Bruges — it’s a beautiful city with canals!
