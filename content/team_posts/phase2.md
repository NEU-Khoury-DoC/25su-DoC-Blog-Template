# Changes Since Phase 1

## User Personas
We slightly altered the backgrounds of two of our users. Now, Eura Peon is considering moving countries; Cara Day is now the owner of a daycare chain instead of a single daycare and is considering going global by opening a daycare in another country. Additionally, some of our user stories have changed. 

## Data Sources
We added a data source.

# Wireframes
Start Page Wireframe: 
![wireframe1](/homeWireframe.jpeg)
This will be the first page users see when they open our site. It will have our logo on the sidebar, the name of our app at the top of the screen, and options for which user they want to sign in as. Each option will have the picture of the user, their name, and a short description of them. 


Paul E. Tishan Wireframes: 
![wireframe2](/birthPredictorWireframe.jpeg)
This screen will be shown after the user logs in as Paul E. Tishan and chooses to use the birth rate predictor. There will be a picture that represents Paul E. Tishan on the sidebar as well as the options to go back home, visit our about section, and logout. There are a lot of different inputs the user can adjust to change the predicted birth rate shown towards the bottom of the screen. Paul will use this to see what policy changes his country can make to increase birth rates, such as increasing the amount parents can receive in daycare grants. 

![wireframe3](/legislationWireframe.jpeg)
This screen will be shown after the user logs in as Paul E. Tishan and chooses the legislation finder. The user can change the country with a dropdown menu. This will cause the graph on the right to show that country's birth rate over time and cause different laws that country has made regarding focus areas that affect birth rate. Focus areas include social protection benefits, birth grants, daycare grants, etc. The user can also change the focus area in order to filter the laws so they only show legislation passed about that specific focus. 


Cara Day Wireframes: 
![wireframe4](/businessWireframe.jpeg)
This screen will be shown after the user logs in as Cara Day and chooses business planning. The user can choose which country they want to see information about and what year in case they want to look at historical data. They can choose a store location so they can set/update the opening and closing times for that location, as well as set the cost that parent pay each month for their child to go to the daycare. I am considering adding in a "Add New Location" button so that the user can add a store in a new country like Cara Day is considering doing. 

![wireframe5](/parentResearchWireframe.jpeg)
This screen will be shown after the user logs in as Cara Day and chooses parent research. The user can select a country and different articles about things that trouble parents will be shown. The articles will show the name of the article, the author, the date it was published, and a link to the article. 


Eura Peon Wireframes: 
![wireframe6](/countryPredictorWireframe.jpeg)
This screen will be shown after the user logs in as Eura Peon and chooses country predictor. The user can adjust the weekly hours they'd prefer to work, select the benefits they find most important (ex: day care grants, birth grants, etc.), toggle on/off if they care about the birth rate of a country, and select the year in the future they want to get their top 3 for. This will generate the top 3 countries based on their inputs. By clicking on the country, the user will get a small paragraph about the country. This screen may also be able to be used for Cara Day when looking for the best location for her new store, but as of now it is designed for Eura Peon. 

![wireframe7](/resourceFinderWireframe.jpeg)
This screen will be shown after the user logs in as Eura Peon and chooses resource finder. The user can input the country and focus area (ex: single mothers, working mothers, women in STEM, etc.) for the resources they would like to see. Then a list of resources will be generated, including helpful articles, charities that donate to the focus area inputted, afinity groups related to the focus group, etc. Each resource listed will be able to show the country it is from/in, when it was founded/published, what focus area it is under, and a link to the resource.
