# Changes Since Phase 1

## User Personas
We slightly altered the backgrounds of two of our users. Now, Eura Peon is considering moving countries; Cara Day is now the owner of a daycare chain instead of a single daycare and is considering going global by opening a daycare in another country. Additionally, some of our user stories have changed. 

## Data Sources
We added a data source. 

Description of data source: This dataset provides many detailed statistics on different expenditures aimed at families and children within EU member states. Itcategorizes these expenditures based off of what is provided, such as cash benefits and what kind. The data was collected annually and accessed on EUROstat.different nations. 


- Dimensions: Country, Year, Type of Benefit, Means-Testing
- Units: Monetary values presented in millions of euros, or euro per person
- Observations: Each data point represents the expenditure for a specific country, year, type of benefit, and means-testing status


Relevance: This dataset is relevant in understanding the allocation of recources towards child welfare across Europe. It can be used to assess how different countries offer family support within their social protection systems and how these benefits have changed over time. This is relevant for an aspiring parent, who might consider the different benefits countries offer for family support as possible considerations to relocate. This data is vital for politicians as well, to assess how different types of expenditure across countries correspond with birth rates.

# Wireframes
Start Page Wireframe: 
![wireframe1](/homeWireframe.jpeg)
This will be the first page users see when they open our site. It will have our logo on the sidebar, the name of our app at the top of the screen, and options for which user they want to sign in as. Each option will have the picture of the user, their name, and a short description of them. 


Paul E. Tishan Wireframes: 
![wireframe2](/birthPredictorWireframe.jpeg)
This screen will be shown after the user logs in as Paul E. Tishan and chooses to use the birth rate predictor. There will be a picture that represents Paul E. Tishan on the sidebar as well as the options to go back home, visit our about section, and logout. There are a lot of different inputs the user can adjust to change the predicted birth rate shown towards the bottom of the screen. Paul will use this to see what policy changes his country can make to increase birth rates, such as increasing the amount parents can receive in daycare grants. 

![wireframe3](/legislationWireframe.jpeg)
This screen will be shown after the user logs in as Paul E. Tishan and chooses the legislation finder. The user can change the country with a dropdown menu. This will cause the graph on the right to show that country's birth rate over time and cause different laws that country has made regarding focus areas that affect birth rate. Focus areas include social protection benefits, birth grants, daycare grants, etc. The user can also change the focus area in order to filter the laws so they only show legislation passed about that specific focus.
