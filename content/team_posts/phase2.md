# Changes Since Phase 1

## User Personas
We slightly altered the backgrounds of two of our users. Now, Eura Peon is considering moving countries; Cara Day is now the owner of a daycare chain instead of a single daycare and is considering going global by opening a daycare in another country. Additionally, some of our user stories have changed. 

## Data Sources
We added a data source.

# Wireframes
Start Page Wireframe: 
![wireframe1](/homeWireframe.jpeg)
This will be the first page users see when they open our site. It will have our logo on the sidebar, the name of our app at the top of the screen, and options for which user they want to sign in as. Each option will have the picture of the user, their name, and a short description of them. 


Paul E. Tishan Wireframes: 
![wireframe2](/birthPredictorWireframe.jpeg)
This screen will be shown after the user logs in as Paul E. Tishan and chooses to use the birth rate predictor. There will be a picture that represents Paul E. Tishan on the sidebar as well as the options to go back home, visit our about section, and logout. There are a lot of different inputs the user can adjust to change the predicted birth rate shown towards the bottom of the screen. Paul will use this to see what policy changes his country can make to increase birth rates, such as increasing the amount parents can receive in daycare grants. 

![wireframe3](/legislationWireframe.jpeg)
This screen will be shown after the user logs in as Paul E. Tishan and chooses the legislation finder. The user can change the country with a dropdown menu. This will cause the graph on the right to show that country's birth rate over time and cause different laws that country has made regarding focus areas that affect birth rate. Focus areas include social protection benefits, birth grants, daycare grants, etc. The user can also change the focus area in order to filter the laws so they only show legislation passed about that specific focus.

# Data Visualization


# ER Diagrams

No matter if our users want to grasp the current climate as a to-be parent, understand as a daycare operator, propose legislation as a politician, the data structure of our app seeks to help them understand their decisions that transforms their own life, those in their community, or the European Unionâ€™s ~450 million people.
