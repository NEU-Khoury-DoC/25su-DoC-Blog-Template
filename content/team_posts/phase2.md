# Project Updates
As a result of the feedback we received, we made several changes to the refugee, Mohammed, and lawyer, Mark, user personas. 
## [Mohammed](https://droidbait66.github.io/Team10/team_posts/phase1post/#mohammed-is-a-17-year-old-boy-from-syria-he-is-a-practicing-muslim-his-parents-were-recently-killed-due-to-bombings-in-his-area-and-he-is-seeking-asylum-with-his-5-year-old-sister-and-10-year-old-brother)
* Three of our user stories utilized the same application feature, so, we condensed these user stories into one. Rather than three separate pages 
for country ranking, asylum acceptance probability, and aslyum application demographic statistics, these will all be shown on one page which illustrates all of these data. 
* We added two new stories which will allow our users to view data regarding religous cliamte and demographics and also information about education systems/ rankings. 

## [Mark](https://droidbait66.github.io/Team10/team_posts/phase1post/#mark-is-a-german-lawyer-seeking-pro-bono-opportunities-he-wants-to-provide-legal-aid-for-refugees)
* Our user stories reffered to four separate lawyers as opposed to one persona utilizing four separate features. We fixed the stories so that they all refer to one lawyer
persona, Mark. 
* Our user stories were also very vague and failed to outline specific features that Mark would use to help with finding pro bono work opportunities.
    * We included a feature that allows users to historical trends of asylum rejection rates by country and citizenship, total received applications per country, asylum decision types, and acceptance rate per applicant demographic group (ie. age, sex, country origin).
