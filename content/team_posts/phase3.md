# Project: Phase 3 Deliverable

- provide screenshots of the mocked up app and results of the implemented
  functionality, including calling the ML model

### Changes to the model since Phase 2

Since phase 2, we have made various changes to the data model, which are shown in our entity relationship diagram and relational mapping. We added a User_Role entity to match industry standards and ensure that there can be many different users for each persona. On top of this, we took into consideration that the Post feature, as seen for the activist Faye, did not make a large enough impact and did not add value to the overall project design, so we eliminated that feature in our application and the Post entity in our data model. Instead, for Faye, we included an entity, Organization. This allows the activists to see current organizations working in a specific area, whether that be education, health, environment, or safety. Through this new feature, Faye is able to learn more about organizations in a particular country that align with the factor she is most interested in. Additionally, we made minor changes regarding attributes and relationships in our ever-changing process to build a database that supports our needs.

### Data and ML issues

Upon revisiting our EDA and attempting to write our PCA, we noticed significant gaps in the data we had for
features such as Happiness index and Infrastructure scores. Many countries completely lacked the needed infrastructure score data, this meant our Cosine similarity model and our planned PCA and Autoregression model needed to be changed. Our Cosine model was inaccurate because it was missing certain countries entirely because they had no data for infrastructure.

To resolve this immediate issue, we decided to drop the infrastructure feature because we valued having more nations to be compared than having more features to compare.

This decision has implications for our supervised model as well. Because of the many random missing datapoints across all features, years and countries, we must find a way to plug the gaps.

We can solve the above by averaging the data from the previous and next year and inputting it as dummy data in the years that are missing some. We would definitely lose accuracy by doing this but otherwise we would have insufficient data. Alternatively, we could build another ML model to predict the most likely values for those missing years by using the previous and next years for that country. However, I don't think we have the time to implement such a model on such short notice, so we have updated our data, first removing infrastructure as a factor and filling all other gaps in the data by averaging data from the previous and next year.

We planned to do a PCA to reduce the number of columns we had, but we realized that we didn't need to do this because we had 12 columns of data for 27 countries, which is enough data to not have to do PCA when initially building our regressor model. So, we began building our time-series autoregressor model, which is currently completely built and running as expected, but has not yet been tested or cross-validated.

### Data for ML

Health, education, safety, and environment will be the features used for both our ML models. Our improved EDA from phase 2 has helped show us that these factors have strong positive correlation between them and quality of life, which lead us to the conclusion that they will be good at helping us predict future quality of life. We removed transportation/infrastructure as a feature due to large gaps in available data, but also, all visualizations created with this factor showed weaker correlation between it and quality of life, which means that it probably wouldn't have helped us too much in our prediction model. 

We will be using health, education, safety, and environment in our cosine similarity model. Users will be able to input their own personal level of significance for each factor, and the relative signficance of each factor will be used to determine the cosine similarity of those chosen factors and countries in the EU.

### Rest API Matrix
<div style="width: 960px; height: 720px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:960px; height:720px" src="https://lucid.app/documents/embedded/7c38fc78-a0ca-4f35-a835-330b3ea030ba" id="BBhm5xdp_0DS"></iframe></div>


Currently, our REST API Matrix looks like this. The blueprint of users ties to features of our application that will be implemented in the next stage, which allows the removal of a user by user_id or updating a username. Additionally, we can retrieve information about the user attributes for a certain user_id and their role, which will help adapt our Home Page to a UI allowing users to select their username to log in in the next phase.

The blueprint grace relates to the interaction with the predicted scores from our cosine similarity model, which is seen with the persona grace when she can select the option to view a map of recommendations, which takes her to a page where she uses sliders to adjust how much each factor of education, health, safety, and environment mean to her which she can then save these preferences using the button which connects with our Post route. These preferences are then reflected in the European Union gradient map. 

The blueprint model allows retrieving similarity scores from the cosine similarity ML model.

The blueprint country allows for the retrieval of all country names, which is used in multiple places in our application. Grace is able to select a country for university recommendations, and James is able to choose a country to view the one most similar to it. The other routes for this blueprint allow for the retrieval of factors and countries, which will be further integrated into our design.

The blueprint faye retrieves organizations based on country_ID and factor_ID, which is implemented in her persona. She can view existing organizations by selecting a country and a factor. 

### Current App 

![homepage_img](home.jpg)
Home page of our application that all users are greeted with and asks them which user they would like to log in as. Our next step is to have the user be able to choose the username with which they will log in to the persona as. 

![homepage_img](gracehome.jpg)
Clicking the button to act as Grace takes the user to this page which gives them the choice between viewing country recommendations based on their preferences in the factors of education, health, safety, and environment and viewing university recommendations for a chosen country. 

![grace_rec_map_img](grace_rec_map.jpg)
By choosing to view country recommendations, the user is able to adjust the sliders of each factor to their preference and either save their preference or compare their previous preferences. 

![grace_save_pref_img](grace_map_pref.jpg)
![grace_save_pref_img](grace_save_prefe.jpg)
The user can adjust the sliders to suit their preferences on each factor and click save preferences to see a gradient map using our cosine similarity ML model.

![grace_pref_hist_img](grace_pref_hist.jpg)
By clicking the option to compare preference history, the user is able to select from their previous runs to compare the top recommendations which will show graphs of the predicted quality of life scores for each country using our time series autoregressive model which we will soon implement.  

![grace_univ_recs_img](grace_univ_recs.jpg)
By using the sidebar to see university recommendations the user can select from a dropdown of all 27 EU countries and view the 3 top universities with information regarding them.


![james_home_img](james_home.jpg)
After logging out of Grace and acting as James this is the page displayed. It gives the options for the user to go to a page to view recent policy implementation or to view similar countries.

![james_policy_img](james_policy.jpg)
After choosing to view recent policy implementation the user is able to select up to two factors to view policies on. After clicking view policies, three links to recent news articles and information will be displayed. In the future, we will be implementing web scraped news.

![james_sim_img](james_sim.jpg)
Through using the sidebar the user can then choose a country from the EU member states to get the country most similar to it. We will implement an interactive map displaying countries most similar to the chosen country using our cosine similarity ML model.

![faye_home_img](faye_home.jpg)
After logging out of James, the user can log in to the activist persona, Faye, which takes them to this page which gives them the option to view a map of expansion recommendations, the quality of life change over time, or current organizations.

![faye_map_need_img](faye_map_need.jpg)
By clicking to view the map of expansion recommendations the user is able to select one factor and view a map displaying the areas with the lowest scores in that area. This allows the activist to view countries of need to direct their efforts to.

![faye_org_img](faye_org.jpg)
The QoL sidebar page is currently not implemented but with the current organizations the user is able to choose a country and factor to see three current organizations that are working in that area. The organizations and information on them are mock data.
 
Our application is a work in progress and we are excited to continue improving and implementing our features further!
