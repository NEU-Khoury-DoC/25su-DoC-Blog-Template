# Welcome to our blog!

Welcome to the team's Blog! Our names are Sophie Farrell, John Nguyen, Emma Kulla, and Mia Giargiari. We're on our Dialogue of Civilizations in Belgium and will be working on a project combining our skill sets in machine learning and databases to explore the global declining birth rate and different factors related to the issue.
