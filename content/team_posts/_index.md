# Welcome to the Belgian Bloggersâ€™ Website!

Our names are Alex Angione, Sienna Boos, Trayna Bui, and Emily Moy. We are Northeastern students in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and are participating in a Dialogue of Civilizations based in Leuven, Belgium! Our dialogue is called Data and Software in International Government and Politics, so aside from taking technical DS/CS classes, we have also been learning about the ins and outs of government and the role that data plays in the industry. Throughout the program, we will be working on a full-stack web application which will tie together our computer science skills and our knowledge of international politics. This website will host our team and individual blog posts, and we hope you enjoy reading about our experiences abroad.
