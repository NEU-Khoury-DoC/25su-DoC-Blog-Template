# Project Description
Due to increasing global tensions, over 117.3 million people have been displaced due to conflicts and violence. Although many countries have been welcoming, other countries have instead responded by closing their border to those seeking asylum. This leaves millions of innocent people homeless, hungry, and unsafe in unfamiliar and unwelcoming territories. Our application aims to address this issue by providing a variety of curated information to a unique spread of users. We will help asylum seekers select the location most likely to accept them into the country based on social and political climate and historical acceptance rates of asylum seekers. Moreover, our application helps EU politicians decide where it is best to allocate aid funds. Finally, we will help lawyers find locations to base pro bono services from in order to make the most impact through their work. Through these efforts, a safer world will be available to Asylum Seekers!
