# Project - Phase 1 Deliverable

## Project Description

A country’s quality of life provides important insight into the well-being of citizens and their satisfaction with the standards of living. Rather than simply relying on a single statistic to determine a country’s success, quality of life encapsulates a broader sense of how people feel about their experiences. This is typically based on several factors, and for our project we will be focusing on the following: Healthcare, Education, Safety, Culture, Environment, and Transportation.

Our application aims to provide information and insights about and related to the quality of life in EU countries in 2023. It will assist with decision making on a personal, commercial, and governmental level. A student can use this application to assess which country to attend university in by ranking their priorities, while a government official can input their country in order to identify their most lacking factor, discover the country most similar to theirs, and gain insight from recent policy implementations. Additionally, a social organization can determine the best opportunities for expansion by identifying the countries underperforming in their target focus.

The application will utilize a combination of classification and clustering in order to provide valuable insights to its users. The ultimate goal is to help users understand the factors that determine their quality of life and subsequently make informed decisions through moving, policy implementation, or providing aid.

## Persona 1

Grace Monova is an 18 year old woman who wants to move to a new country for university. Grace is outgoing, loves traveling and is dedicated to her studies. She is excited to start a life in a brand new country and wants to ensure a good fit given her priorities and concerns. She is very intelligent and values receiving a high quality education. Also, being a young woman living in a new place, she wants to find a country that is generally safe and has low crime rates. She cares about meeting people from different backgrounds and appreciates opportunities for integration in the country’s culture. The process of researching which EU country is best suited for her is grueling and time consuming, so she wishes for an easier way.

### User Stories

- As a student who values the quality of my education, I want to find a country with high education rates so that I receive a strong academic experience.
- As a young individual, I prioritize meeting people from new countries and learning about new cultures, so I want to find a country that provides opportunities for integration and community building in order for me to better adapt to life as a local.
- As a young woman, I want to find a country with a low crime rate so that I feel safe while exploring new places.
- As a busy student, I am overwhelmed by the decision making process and want to find an application that will show me the “best” country for me based on my preferences so that I can save time and make the most factual decision.

## Persona 2

James Gardinier is a 56 year old member of the French parliament. He recently had a discussion about the World Happiness Index with a Danish friend, and found out that France ranked 30th in 2023 while Denmark ranked 3rd globally. This made him wonder about the ways in which France could increase their ranking in the index, which requires an increase in quality of life. He is unsure about what factors are dragging France down compared to Denmark, and wants to see how other countries are working to raise their ranking. This would allow him to act appropriately as a policymaker.

### User Stories

- As a French policymaker comparing my country to those that rank higher, I want to see which factors are pulling down France’s score so that I know where to focus my attention.
- As a government worker, I want to make informed decisions based on historical evidence by learning about past policy implementations in my area of focus so that I can ensure the success of proposed legislation.
- As a member of parliament, I want to learn about the efforts of countries that perform similarly to France so that I can gain new perspectives from outside of French culture.
- As a full-time official, I want to be able to use an application to find similar countries and recent policy implementations for me so that I can use my time wisely and still make informed decisions.

## Persona 3

Faye Mulligan is a 26 year old Swiss activist. She works at an organization that aims to raise awareness about environmental issues such as air pollution and reducing carbon emissions. The organization was founded several years ago in Switzerland and has had great success in increasing environmental consciousness in Switzerland, so it is now looking to expand into the EU. Faye has been tasked with finding three EU countries in which the organization would be most needed and would be likely to make a strong impact.

### User Stories

- As an activist focused on environmental impact, I want to identify countries where air quality and pollution is the worst so that I know where our organization is most needed.
- As the worker who has been tasked with this expansion research, I want to find the countries with the highest need in order to ensure the organization's success and increase public awareness most appropriately.
- As a Swiss citizen, I want to make informed decisions about the EU despite the lack of firsthand experience so that I fully understand the details of this expansion and approach these issues objectively.
- As an environmentalist, I want to be able to use an application that provides me with output tailored to my field so that I don’t have to filter results unnecessarily.
