# Changes Since Phase 3

In regard to our models, phase four is where they truly began to take shape! We completely integrated both our models. Model one evolved from phase two, with all cubed features being removed, as well as adding a year feature, making the model predict the birth rateg for 2024. Since phase three, we have further developed all pages of our app, creating different visualizations and features to add value to our users' experience.
