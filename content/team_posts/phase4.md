# Changes Since Phase 3



## Visualizations

![percapita](/CaraVizPerCapita.png)

We edited a previous visualization that was created for phase 3, which was a choropleth heatmap which showed the amounts of grants each country in the EU recieved for childcare expenditure. The edit that we made was switching it to show the amount per capita rather than the total for each country, so that the number was not just reliant on the country's population.

## Models
In regard to our models, phase four is where they truly began to take shape! We completely integrated both our models. Model one evolved from phase two, with all cubed features being removed, as well as adding a year feature, making the model predict the birth rateg for 2024. Since phase three, we have further developed all pages of our app, creating different visualizations and features to add value to our users' experience.
