# Elevator Pitch
What if choosing where to live could mean the difference between getting care in time or not at all? For millions around the world, navigating healthcare systems across borders is daunting. Whether you're a parent moving abroad, a global health student, or a policymaker planning national reform, making informed decisions about healthcare shouldn't require a PhD in public health. 

That’s where **CareCompass** comes in.

CareCompass is a data-powered platform that transforms global health complexity into clarity. We allows users to explore country profiles, compare healthcare performance, and receive personalized recommendations based on their priorities.

With interactive maps, side-by-side comparisons, and future-facing projections powered by machine learning, CareCompass helps users not just understand where countries stand today, but where they’re headed. In a world where access to care isn't guaranteed by geography, CareCompass helps you choose not just where to live but how to live well.
