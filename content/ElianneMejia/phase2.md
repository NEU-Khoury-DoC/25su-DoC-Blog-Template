 I took the lead on creating our ER diagrams and the translation of them to the final relational model. One of my group partners made a draft for database's SQL code. I reviews this and fixed all of our syntax errors then ran the script in DataGrip to ensure it works as expected. Finally, I added the working SQL file to our project repository and tested composing the application. Moreover, I worked with my team to develop an inital wireframe and logo for our web application. 

 This past week we got the chance to visit a museum of computing in Namur. I really enjoyed this excursion as it was interesting to learn about how computers have changed throughout the years. Seeing earlier computing models highlights how much progress we have made in technology and has allowed me to have a greater appreciion for the tools we have now. We were shown an old floppy disk that had a storage capcacity lower than what would be needed to store even a single iPhone photo. This really stuck with me and emphasized how powerful devices today are in comparison to older technology.
