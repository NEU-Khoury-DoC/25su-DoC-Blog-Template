Hi, My name is Zoya Siddiqui, and I am a DS+Biochem major at Northeastern University. I am currently studying abroad in Leuven, and I am here to expand my technical skills and learn more about international government and politics and how I can apply it to my major. Ultimately, my goal is to use my data science skills in the biotechnology industry in order to help improve people's lives on a biological level, and to get there, I am currently curating those skills by working on our app, Best Life, to help improve people's lives on a societal level.
