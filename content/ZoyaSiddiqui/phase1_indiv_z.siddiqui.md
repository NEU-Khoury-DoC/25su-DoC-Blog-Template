# Phase 1 Project Contributions
Throughout the process of creating our phase 1 team deliverable, I was an active participant in the brainstorming and problem-solving process. We went through many different ideas, including topics related to news, politics, education, energy costs, and quality of life. We finally settled on focusing on creating a quality of life index app given country and certain factors. In this phase, I helped our group talk through these ideas and figure out the logistics of our final topic idea, particularly in figuring out how to implement a linear regression model to predict quality of life given certain user-inputted factors.

Once we determined our final topic idea, I drafted some of our user personas and user stories, figuring out how exactly our app could be applied to different archetypes and coming up with backstories for these individuals, and then writing out the applications of our app for them personally.

# Experiences on the Dialogue
The past nine days have been absolutely filled with some of the most amazing (and draining) experiences of my entire life. I've never been having this much fun while being this tired ever. 

I've never really traveled outside of North America before, and so everything about this trip has been very novel. From the two-hour customs line to learning more about the EU than I'd ever want to really know, this past week has been an absolute whirlwind of excitement and exhaustion.

## Here are some of the highlights so far:

### The Atomium
I could've sat here for hours.

### The Whole Group
Felt very American dominating this place in this L-shape.

### First Impressions
Leuven truly is a gorgeous little city.

## Ultimately...
It has been an absolutely insane week and I can't wait to do it all again next week, and the next, and the next.
