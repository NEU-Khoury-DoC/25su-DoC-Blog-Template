# About Zoya Siddiqui
Hi, I'm Zoya! I'm a data science and biochemistry major at Northeastern University, and I am currently studying abroad in Leuven, Belgium! This program has allowed me to vastly expand my data science skills, and I have learned a lot here about international government and politics and how we can apply DS principles in that field. I am excited to continue learning more about machine learning models in DS3000 and apply the skills I learn on my team project. This is vastly different and more extensive than any other data science project I have ever done, and while at times it has been overwhelming, it is also incredibly exciting to have been given this opportunity.

## Leuven Highlights
Being in Belgium has been very cool - I've never left North America before, so this has been an awesome cultural experience along with the very valuable academic aspect of it all. I like to consider myself a foodie, so here I'd like to leave some of the best food I've had here in Leuven - I'm picky, so you know it's good.
