# Phase 3 Project Contributions
In Phase 3 of our project, I contributed by performing more EDA on our API data, creating new graphs based on the feedback from our phase 2 blog post and uploading them in proper HTML format this time. We also discovered a lot of issues with missing data recently while attempting to do PCA for our regression model, and I cleaned up our data a bit more to fill some of these holes and also removed the infrastructure feature of our dataset due to the sheer amount of missing data that column had. I also worked on the PCA for our regression model, creating a new dataframe with unstandardized data and reading that dataframe into a CSV to pass through my PCA function. Then, while talking to Dr. Gerber, we realized that we no longer needed to do PCA, and I went on to build our time series autoregressor model instead, which is completed and should be working correctly now, but still needs to be tested and cross-validated. I also worked on the current_orgs page for our website, and wrote a small portion of the data issues section on our team blog post, as well as a large portion of the data for ML section.

# Experiences on the Dialogue
This last weekend's trip to Luxembourg has definitely been a highlight of the trip for me. While I'm still skeptical about Luxembourg as a city (definitely has some weird folks out at night), it was absolutely gorgeous and really fun respite from the intense academics of this program. Highlights below:

### Adventure Time!
Dr. Gerber took us over the valley and through the woods to get Thai food.

### Cool Jacket
Bought this jacket at a market in the square! The guy who sold it to me was a hot air balloon pilot, very cool.

### Awesome Lake
It was so pretty here - unfortunately did not swim much because I am a terrible swimmer, but still. Very pretty!
