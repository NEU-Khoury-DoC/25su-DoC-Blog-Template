# Phase II Individual Deliverable
For Phase II, my contributions were as follows:
	•	Developed the full pipeline to collect, clean, and process voting data from the HowTheyVote.eu API, resulting in three structured dataframes (mep_ref.csv, vote_id_ref.csv, heart_votes.csv) used throughout our application.
	•	Helped design a draft of individualized MEP profile layout in Streamlit, including a dropdown selection tool and bar chart to visualize party loyalty vs. dissent.
	•	Helped ideate and create the wireframes for the "citizen" & "homepage", prioritizing clarity, accessibility, and transparency in how political data is presented to non-expert users.
	•	Participated in group design discussions to build user personas and drafted interface features such as watchlists and reference links tailored for political journalists, citizens, and advocacy groups.
	•	Built the foundation for local and global data models to represent different stakeholders and how they interact with political information.
	•	Contributed to drafting the team blog post to document and communicate our process, motivations, and outcomes.

This project has been a personally valuable experience. I found it rewarding to bridge data science with civic engagement and make complex political information more understandable. Overall, this week was a truly wonderful experience. My favorite part was visiting the NAM-IP computer museum in Namur. It was great to see the evolution of computers, especially the early machines that laid the foundation for what we do with data today. It made me think about the advancements in technology and the importance of keeping it accessible.
