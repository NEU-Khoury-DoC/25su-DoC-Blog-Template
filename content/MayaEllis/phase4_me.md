# Individual Deliverable - Phase 4

## Contributions

In Phase 4, we focused on finalizing our application so that all pages were functional and aesthetically pleasing. I worked on the implementation of the second ML model, which was the timeseries autoregressor. This required a couple new routes and specific adjustments on each page. I also added tables to the database that we hadn't previously considered in order to support this model. I contributed significantly to the UI of our app as well, specifically the pages that show our timeseries plot and the organizations and universities pages. I also worked on the past preferences page in order to get all of the graphs and tables to show up properly. I changed the format of the policy implementation page and created the QoL comparison page for the third persona. 

There were a couple changes to our database as well in order to accomodate new pages that we created and hadn't accounted for in our initial ERD. For UI, I changed some title formatting as well as some page layouts and the logo. I also created the about page and included team pictures. Our app is now fully functional!

## Experiences

This past week, we went to Energyville and the CMine in Genk. I thought that this excursion was quite interesting and I learned a lot about the heating process that Energyville was attempting to implement. It was really cool to see their lab, especially the artificial sun. I also enjoyed the CMine since I'd never been to one before. We climbed all the way to the top of the tower there and got a nice view of the surrounding area. Our team lead a speaker debrief for Sophie Meszaros this week. She spoke about smart cities and the attempt for more widespread implementation of smart city practices, which I had never heard of before. It made me consider the struggle of public sector organizations, since she discussed the lack of traction that her organization was facing. I also went to Antwerp last week, which was super fun!

## Dialogue Reflection

I've had a great time on this Dialogue! This has been an incredibly educational experience yet also very fun. It was quite different from the other study abroad experience I had (N.U.in) in terms of scheduling and coursework. At first, I was expecting to be overwhelmed due to the high workload and packed daily itinerary, but I ended up feeling like I had a good amount of free time to balance it out. The program was very well organized and I thought that all of our excursions were interesting and provided insight into topics that I hadn't previously considered. I've also really enjoyed getting to know everyone on the program and getting such close instruction from the professors. Overall, this has been a super valuable 5 weeks and I definitely learned a lot!
