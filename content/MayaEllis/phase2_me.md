# Individual Deliverable - Phase 2

For Phase 2 of our project, my main contributions centered around ER diagrams, wireframes, and concept clarity. I drew out the ER diagrams for the global model and the three local digrams, and I determined the relationships between all of our entities. I also drew the wireframes for our Streamlit application, which involved a significant amount of brainstorming in order to structure the pages. As a team, we clarified our concept and broke it down into smaller, more manageable pieces, and I revamped the user stories for our personas. I suggested a couple features to our application, such as adding a page where a student can view the top three universities of their top recommended country. I also thought of the idea to let the activist post on an external social media site directly from the app, where they would also be able to access their post history. I also contributed to the team blog post by discussing the areas I worked on for this phase.

This week, my favorite part of the program was visiting Namur. I thought that the Computer Museum was very interesting and taught me a lot about the history of computing. I also enjoyed being able to see the inside of a computer and gain more understanding about how it all works. I am looking forward to going to Luxembourg this weekend and visiting Eurostat since we're using Eurostat datasets in our project. I think it'll be interesting and definitely relevant for us to learn about how they operate. I also enjoyed bowling with everyone this week!
