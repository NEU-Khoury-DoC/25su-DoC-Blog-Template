# About Maya Ellis

I'm a DS and Economics major at Northeastern University. I'm excited to be in Belgium and learn more about the intersection of software and international government and politics.

## Belgium
I've really enjoyed being in Belgium so far, and I feel that I've learned a lot about international politics, particularly understanding how the EU functions. I had no prior knowledge of the inner workings of the EU, such as the different branches and the organization's goals. I find it really interesting how each branch contributes to passing new legislation.

Some fun facts about me are:
- I have been playing piano for 14 years!
- I love boxing
- I enjoy baking scones
