# Individual Deliverable - Phase 3

For Phase 3 of our project, I mainly worked with the ERD refinement and route creation, as well as front end page creation. I finalized our SQL database and implemented new entities, such as Organization and University. I was responsible for several routes, including getting universities, getting organizations, getting country, getting factor, posting preferences, and getting ML model 1. I was able to implement all of these on the web page, and I created several of the corresponding pages as well. I created the university student's home page, university recommendation page, country recommender map page, current organizations based on factor and country page, and the past preferences page, which is still in progress due to the lack of ML model 2 as of now.

My highlight of the week was Luxembourg! I really enjoyed getting to explore a new country and learn a bit about its history through the walking tour. I thought Luxembourg was cool, and it felt very small yet lively. My favorite part was going up the Looksembourg, which was a little car that took you up to see the city from a higher point. I also liked going down into the lower city and finding a skatepark. I'm looking forward to continuing our project in the coming week, since I feel more confident in its functionality now that some routes are actually working and responding to user input. I can't believe we only have one week left!
