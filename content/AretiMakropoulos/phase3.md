# Phase 3 Contributions

During phase 3, I collaborated with Maya to change our data models. Based on some changes we made with the overall application, specifically with our activist, Faye, we have a new feature to see organizations related to her factor of choice (education, health, safety, environment) in a country of choice. I changed the Relational Mapping to reflect our current state of the database. Additionally, I generated mock data using Mockaroo for our entities' Organization and User, which I then inserted into our DDL. I worked with Maya to plan our current routes and wrote and debugged multiple GET, PUT, and DELETE routes. I used Lucidchart to design the REST API Matrix and implemented it in our team blog post. In the team blog post, I wrote about the changes to our data models since phase 2 and detailed our adaptations to feedback and changes in design. I also described the REST API Matrix and tied it back to our wireframes. Lastly, in the team blog post, I explained the current state of our application and plans for the other ML model and pages. 


## Experiences

This past week we had the opportunity to visit Eurostat in Luxembourg. Our trip was highly relevant to the current project as we used multiple datasets from Eurostat in our application. It was a fantastic opportunity to learn more about the process by which Eurostat harmonizes data provided to them by member states. I learned a lot through the deep dive into the thought process behind the surveys that collect the data for Innovation and Digitalisation datasets, which was extremely interesting.

So grateful that we were able to explore Luxembourg!
