# Phase 3 Project Contributions

During phase 3, I collaborated with Maya in the changing of our data models. Based on some changes that we made with the overall application specifically with our activist, Faye, having the new feature to see organizations related to her factor of choice (education, health, safety, environment) in a country of choice. I changed the Relational Mapping to reflect our current state of the database. Additionally, I generated mock data using Mockaroo for our entities Organization and User which I then inserted into our DDL. I worked with Maya to plan the routes we currently have and I wrote and debugged multiple GET, PUT, and DELETE routes. I used Lucidchart to design the REST API Matrix and implemented that in our team blog post. On the team blog post I wrote about the changes to our data models since phase 2 and detailed our adaptations to feedback and changes in design. I also described the REST API Matrix and tied them back to our wireframes. Lastly, in the team blog post I explained the current state of our application and future plans for the other ML model and pages. 


## Experiences

This past week we had the opportunity to visit Eurostat in Luxembourg. Our trip was extremely relevant to the current project as we use multiple datasets from Eurostat in our application. It was a fantastic opportunity being able to learn more about the process in which Eurostat harmonises data provided to them by member states. I learned a lot through the deep dive into the thought process behind the surveys that collect the data for Innovation and Digitalisation datasets was extremely interesting to learn about.
