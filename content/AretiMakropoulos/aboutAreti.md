Hey! My name is Areti Makropoulos, and I am a CS student at Northeastern University. I am currently studying abroad in Belgium to expand my technical skills and gain a broader understanding of cultural and international government. Learning more about databases in CS 3200 and working on a team project allows me to continue learning and applying my skills.

## Favorites In Belgium

There have been so many enriching experiences during this trip. Exploring more about the European Union through various speakers and visits to the European Parliament and European Commission has grown my understanding of the inner workings of the EU and increased my curiosity about politics. Additionally, during our visit to NATO, I learned more about their stance on diplomacy and defense regarding the current conflict with Ukraine and Russia. Many other fascinating excursions have contributed profoundly to my love of Belgium. Some of my favorite Leuven-specific spots to grab a bite or a coffee are Boccone, Pain Louvain, and Chocolatte!
