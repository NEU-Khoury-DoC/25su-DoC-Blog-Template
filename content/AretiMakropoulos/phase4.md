# Phase 4 Contributions



## Experiences

This week our group had the opportunity to lead a reflection on our speaker, Sophie Meszaros, who detailed her work in addressing local challenges and delivering better services to citizens through data spaces. The development of smart communities in which tech solutions are used to improve the management and efficency of urban environments represents a future with a more efficient and sustainable society. This idea ties in greatly to our project which aims to improve individuals lives through a data driven application that simplifies decision making. The similarity lying in the goal of making an impact on individuals' lives and building applications for the impact we wish to have. 

Another experience with touring EnergyVille allowed for a look into achieving sustainable energy.

## Reflection

As my time in the dialogue has come to an end, I cannot help but think back on all of the wonderful experiences during the trip. I am deeply grateful that I had the opportunity to study abroad in Leuven, Belgium developing this project, Best Life, focused on my passions of improving the lives of others. The development of this application 

Not only has this project allowed me to grow, but the interaction of data and software within the European Union has been extremely enlightening. Learning more about the relationships of the government and how the collection and use of data in the EU works.
