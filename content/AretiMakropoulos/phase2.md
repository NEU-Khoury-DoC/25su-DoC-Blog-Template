# Phase 2 Project Contributions

During phase 2, I aided in the adjustments of user stories, allowing us to develop a well rounded application. I helped brainstorm ideas for creating UI wireframes that reflected our user stories. Tweaking and further differentiating user stories to achieve at least two interactive screens for each user persona that encouraged the user to use Best Life repeatedly. I collaborated with Maya in designing the Entity Relationship Diagrams and worked on fine-tuning the relationships and participation. Then, I transformed the ERD into Relational Mapping, using Lucidchart to map out the relationships fully. Using the Relational Mapping of the global data model, I created the initial SQL DDL for our model. I demonstrated my contributions to the team blog post for phase 2 of the Relational Mapping and SQL DDL for our global data model. During this process we continuously modified our application, going into finer detail about the journey we want the user to experience when engaging with Best Life.


## Experiences

Outside of the project and class, we had many impactful speakers who have contributed to our overall understanding of the intersection of international government and technology. Our visit to the Computer Museum NAM-IP in Namur contributed profoundly to our understanding of the history of computers. It allowed me a new appreciation for the computer I use today. Lastly, our discussion on “Embedding Public Service Values in Recommender Systems” with Professor Kevin Carillon allowed a deeper look into the importance of designing algorithms with values in mind. As a computer science student, this is particularly important as I expand my awareness and aim to embed ethical values into the technology I create.
