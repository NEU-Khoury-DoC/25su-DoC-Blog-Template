## Phase 3

For phase 3 I contributed to creating the logistic regression model and implementing it on the app. In order to do this I started off with creating the X matrices, y array, using the cleaned and preprocessed dataset, and a random weight. From here I created the logistic regression function. Once my model was working and returning the weight vector, I created a prediction function to predict the accuracy. I then plotted the actual versus the predicted acceptance rates and changed the alpha and the max_iter sizes, until the correlation increased. I explored the data more by creating a histogram of the residuals, a residual plot versus index, and a residual plot versus the acceptance rate. Then I transferred the jupyter notebook into python script, and I worked with Elianne to implement the model on the app. To do these we added routes so that the user could input their information that would then be put through the model.
During the past week I really enjoyed going to the Wilfried Martens Centre. I liked the speaker's view points and how he didnâ€™t censor the information or his own opinions. I also thought his opinions regarding the US and China were intresting and it was a good change from our other speakers who ar every careful to avoid these topics.
