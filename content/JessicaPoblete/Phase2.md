## Phase 2

For phase 2 I contributed to working through the Eurostat API link and ensuring we could get a singular year of data without the link crashing because there was too much information. I then helped during the data cleaning for the asylum data and talked through what information could be removed from the dataframe. Once a singular year dataframe was created, I took over and created a dataframe with the past 4 years of data because it was the most relevant since it was after COVID. From here I performed EDA and wrote up a summary of the data I saw. Lastly I created a histogram of the data and wrote up a summary of that data as well.

Outside of the project I have learned a lot about the ethics behind AI and technology. This is something that I think is very important because without it, companies can use AI for their own personal gain without considering the implementations that it has on society. And I think that it is good to be reminded of ethics because it can sometimes be forgotten.
