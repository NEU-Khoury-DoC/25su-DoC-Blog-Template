# Phase 1
One thing I learned since coming to Belgium was about how many different components went into the European government. Before coming here I had assumed it was much simpler than it actually is but because it involves so many countries they have to come to terms with the laws that are implemented for the entirety of the European Union. During our guest speaker that talked about the EU decision making process, I found it very interesting how the different heads/presidents of each department were elected, and how each department operated with each other. For the project I helped my group come up with a topic, create user personas, look through data sources, and write the user stories for our lawyer persona.
