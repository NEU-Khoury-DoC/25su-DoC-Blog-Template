# Phase 1 

So far in Belgium, I've enjoyed exploring various parts of Leuven especially trying the different food. I've also enjoyed our excursions to the European Commission, the EU Parliament, and NATO. I've enjoyed hearing from a variety of speakers about everything from the goals of these organizations to the specific roles the AI and computer science in general can play in more traditionally policy/internation affairs oriented fields. Beyond that, I've enjoyed our visit to the atomium and visiting Brugge on my day off. We have also been working on our project so far. My person contributions have been finding the dataset, making sure the features are compatible with potential ML models, and working on the API request.
