# Phase 2 

During the week of the second phase of the project, I not only got to learn a lot technically, but I also enjoyed exploring a lot outside of class and the project course. Some of the highlights of this past week have been our visit to the European Commission. I enjoyed how engaging the speakers were and especially liked hearing their perspective on the EU regulation vs Innovation debate. That combined with the guest lecture really gave me a stronger understanding of the GDPR and how it works as well as its flaws. It made me think a lot about how behind the United States is in terms of regulation and whether our legal system would ever be able to catch up to our technological progress. This is definitely an area that I want to explore further in the future. One of my favorite parts of the week was visiting the Dr.Fontenot's friends patissere. I really enjoyed working with the chocolate even though it was difficult at first and trying all of the different kinds of desserts. In terms of the project, I worked on cleaning and collecting both our Asylum Seeker data and our Social Spending data. I created a function which took in a year as the input and it called the Eurostat API and created a dataframe with our data. During the cleaning process, I basically just removed unnecessary columns and removed rows that contained 0s. I also did summary statsitics and some visualization for the Social Spending Dataset.
