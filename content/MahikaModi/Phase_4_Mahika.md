# Phase 4 

In Phase 4 of the project, I mainly worked on implementing and cross validating our second machine learning model as well as some changes to the UI. The implementation required storing the weights and the raw data in tables and making get requests for them through the API to create matrices and make predictions. We displayed the predictions via a line graph where the user is able to fileter for country and start/end time. I also worked on cross validation and unfortunately our model didn't end up being very good which was unfortunate because of the work we put into it, but I guess it is something we can learn from in the future. Aside from project work, I enjoyed our trip to Energyville and the C-mine. I really liked the lab tour part of Energyville. It was interesting to see the climate chambers and the giant UV lights they used for testing solar panels as well as all the other cool equipment and technology that they had. I enjoyed the tour of the C-mine, the views from the tower were really nice and I liked exploring the giant maze they had outside.
