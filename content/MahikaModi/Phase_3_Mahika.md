# Phase 3 

In Phase 3 of the project, I contributed primarily to the machine learning models. For our logistic model, I contributed to the preprocessing of the data by restructuring the dataframe, combining nonunique aggreagetes,creating the acceptance rates, one hot encoding the data, and splitting in the X and y matrices. For the time series model, I preprocessed the data by removing all Nan values, creating the matrices including the lag columns for each country, the COVID column, and the one hot encoded countries. After that, I used the linear regression formula and got the weights. I was able to plot the residuals and the actual vs predicted data points. Both showed indication that the model was performing well. For the 22_low_accept page for the EU Commissioner page, I cleaned population data and merged it with the dataframe for acceptances and rejections and converted it a csv file to have "acceptances and rejections per capita" to provide more contextualization how many refugees a country accepts or rejects. Outside of project work, I really enjoyed our visit the Wilfried Marten center, it was really interesting to hear from a speaker who wasn't afraid to share their honest opinions and really enjoyed learning about the EU's concerns within the space climate realism, an over reliance of foreign powers on technological hardware, and the battle between regulation and innovation.
