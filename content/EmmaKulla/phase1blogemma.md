# First Week in Belgium
As someone who has had the privilege to travel throughout their life, this past week in Belgium has been unlike anything I have ever experienced! In the average day, I have had amazing food, met fascinating individuals, and formed genuine friendships, all on less than 6 hours of sleep. Every speaker we have heard from has only reinforced my interest in pursuing a future that fosters the collaboration between technology and public policy. As a daughter of European immigrants, I have never felt so informed and up-to-date in the functions of such governmental organizations. Having the opportunity to ask these officials first-hand questions and have personal conversations with them all has been a privilege like no other. One thing I have truly appreciated is how appreciative all the speakers have been towards us; for the most part, they all have seemed extremely thankful to have had the opportunity to speak to us as well as hear our perspectives. Besides hearing from wonderful individuals with years of experience and insightful advice, gelato has been the second highlight of this trip! In regard to the project, my group and I worked collaboratively in brainstorming and determining the overall direction we wanted to head towards, which included possible personas as well as Datasets. As an individual, I worked on the Python code that accessed the API to prove that our data was accessible and could be structured.
