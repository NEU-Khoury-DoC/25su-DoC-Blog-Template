# My Contributions to the Group
Regarding my individual contributions to this phase, I completed the necessary adjustments to model one. Based on the feedback received, I dropped some features, while adding a year feature to make the model truly predictive for the year 2024. I also worked to integrate it into the app itself, using the framework set up from phase 3, as well as John’s UI expertise. With this new model, I then used the predictions made for each country for 2024 (assuming the countries did not change their average weekly working hours or expenditure spending) to extend on to our crude birth rate visualization, letting users toggle between seeing the predictions and not. I adjusted this visualization on the legislation finder page as well. I updated the README’s for both the team repo and the team blog this phase as well, working with my group to further organize these structures. I also worked with Sophie to create visualizations for our Daycare persona using mock data that would be helpful in allowing her to see trends among EU daycares. In regards to the blog, I updated the changes made to model one (including visualizations + assumptions) as well as some general changes made since phase 3.
