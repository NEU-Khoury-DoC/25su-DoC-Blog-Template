## *Strategic Quantitative Advisors for Democracy ("SQuAD") is on a mission to <u>empower the people</u> with tools & knowledge to build better democracies across the globe.*

We build products that provide voters, politicians, and economists with powerful, interactive data visualization tools that reveal how policies impact wealth inequality.

Founded in May 2025, SQuAD was born out of a study abroad experience centered around International Politics and Government. Driven by a vision to bring data literacy to the masses, we built powerful machine learning models and packaged them into user-friendly formats to empower our users with data-driven insights and teachings. Driven by curiosity and a firm commitment to strengthening democracies, we are excited to bring our product to the world!
