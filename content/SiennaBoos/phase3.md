# Project Phase III

For phase III of the project, I contributed to cleaning and processing data for the time series model. I have been the point person for this model, from brainstorming the idea of tracking party cohesion to collecting data, debugging issues, and implementing the ML. I also wrote the ML parts of the team blog post, made the presentation slides, and assisted Emily with feedback to improve the cosine similarity model so it better suits the goals of our user personas.

This week in the dialogue, I loved having the opportunity to visit Luxembourg. Hearing about the work done at Eurostat was very insightful, and I can see myself working at a government statistical agency like that in the future. I also feel like having so much free time over the weekend allowed me to bond with the group more. Lastly, I loved our spontaneous adventure with Dr. Gerber when we travelled through the valley to escape the marathon runners!

We were also able to see this awesome view of Luxembourg on our walking tour!
