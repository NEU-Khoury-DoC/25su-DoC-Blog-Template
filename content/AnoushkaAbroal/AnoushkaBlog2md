For Phase II, I mainly worked on cleaning/processing the rest of our data sources, as well as making sure we implemented the feedback from our last deliverable. I cleaned the datasets from the World Health Organization (W.H.O) data warehouse API, and these datasets for each country were:
- Life Expectancy in Years
- Infant Mortality Rates 
- Households impoverished after out-of-pocket healthcare payments 
- Percentage of Children Vaccinated Against Measles 
- Percentage of Overweight and Obese children
In addition to cleaning the data so that they were each in a dataframe with columns labeled “country,” “year,” and the name of the feature, I also created a couple of visualizations for this data. I created mostly scatter plots, as well as one line graph, to start gaining a general understanding of patterns within the data. The next steps for this would most likely be combining all of the dataset features into one dataframe, and making sure that my dataframe can be merged with the data frame that Arthur Huang has for his processed data sets. I also began to reevaluate what Machine Learning models we were planning to use, and we now know that we want a linear regression model to track some of the features I have listed above over time. I also worked on one of the wireframes with Arthur Huang. 

Outside of the project, I have gained a better footing on linear algebra concepts and linear regression concepts in DS 3000. We learned the motivations behind vector-matrix multiplication, and how you can use those concepts with intercepts and slope to make a line of best fit as a regression model. We also began to learn about binary classification, and how we can apply linear algebra to make a line that evenly splits the data based on a category that we assign to a numerical value (-1 or 1). 

In other news, I have learned a lot more and experienced Belgium more since the time of my last post. I visited Brugge and Antwerp on my free days, and visited some historical museums that allowed me to learn a lot more about Belgium's past, culture, and relation to international affairs. I also enjoyed listening to speakers at the European Commission, and creating some delicious Belgian baked goods/treats.
