For Phase III, I mainly worked on finishing the 2 ML Models in a Jupyter notebook. I transferred the cosine similarity content to a python script, and worked on making the linear regression model for features over time with Arthur. The cosine similarity model will be used to find the countries that have the most similar healthcare systems to other countries. Both models are now transferred to python scripts, and their functionality with hard-coded queries works very well. It is now a matter of figuring out how to store the data and make it appear nicely on the frontend. I also attempted to work on the routes for a few hours, but didn’t exactly get very far, other than gaining a general understanding of the basic GET, POST, and PULL commands. In the end, I created two routes, one to create a table in the database for the ghs_index data, and another to make one for just the General practitioners per 10,000 people dataframe that can later be streamlined for the other factors. In addition, I worked with the others to rethink the wireframes a bit, and we now have a better understanding of how the models fit into each page, and which pages we may want to use for some of the other user personas. 

In terms of Belgium, I have done more exploring in Leuven in general. I have tried some more food locations, and have found that I really enjoy eating the pasta at Boccone. I really enjoyed our trip to Luxembourg as well, where I had a wonderful time watching the night marathon, walking through the valley, using the free transportation, and eating very good food. I also learned a lot recently from our visits to Eurostat and the Wilfried Martin Center for European Studies, where I now understand data regulations in the European Union a bit better, and can identify the biases of someone affiliated with a European political party.
