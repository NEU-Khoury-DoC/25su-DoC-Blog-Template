For this phase, I worked a bit on the user archetypes and user stories to make sure that we put the user first in our application. I also helped research data sources to make sure that we could query the data that we want to use in our machine learning models. 

In terms of the dialogue, I have really enjoyed my time here in Belgium so far. I have learned a lot regarding APIs, Web Scraping, and AI ethics. Using this knowledge will be useful when accessing data for our project and using it in an unbiased way.

Our excursions have also really opened my worldview. Not only am I gaining a better understanding of how the EU works in terms of flow of legislation, but I am also learning about how the different presenters showcase their organization and either hide or present their biases to Americans like us.
