# My first week in Belgium
While being in Belgium, even for such a short amount of time so far, we have learned and experienced so much already, so it is hard to choose just one thing that I found the most interesting. Out of all the speakers we have listened to so far, I would have to chose our visit to NATO and their three speakers to be the most interesting since their presentations and words were applicable to the U.S. and I could connect with it more. As the captain of my debate team in high school, I have always been interested in policy making and politics, so hearing about how they come to consensus and make decisions at NATO was very fascinating. In addition to hearing the speakers, the privlidge alone of just being in that huge headquarters building was really special to me.

# My Contributions To The Group

For this phase of deliverables I had a big part in brainstorming our topic and searching through different API sources to find sources that would work best for topic. I also did the user stories for the polititian user.
