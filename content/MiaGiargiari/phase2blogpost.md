# My Contributions to The Group
In this phase I mainly focused my energy towards coming up with ideas for visualizations then moving forward and creating them. We realized early in the week that the visualizations we made the previous week really did not fit our personas well and didn't solve any problems. The whole group and I spent a lot of time brainstorming new ideas for visualizations closely looking at the user personas and the wireframes made last phase. First I made a bar chart that compares employment status in a user-selected country with the average employment status in all of the European Union. This visualization was made for Eura Pean so she can observe employment trends in different countries and this will aid her in choosing a country to relocate to. This chart took a lot of time because there were three different inputs that I had to tweak continuously. The three inputs are gender, employment status, and country and a big issue I had was the placement of the dropdown menus so they didn’t overlap.

Next I created a choropleth map for Cara Day’s persona. The map showed all European Union countries and colored them coordinating with the total amount received in grants for childcare services. The more the country receives in grants the darker it is colored on the map and the color corresponds with the scale. This choropleth took quite a bit of time since it was the first of this graph type that I have ever made so I had to experiment with a lot of features. 

Lastly I started training our second ML model, which is a recommendation model that takes in desired working hours, importance of benefits, maternity benefits, cash benefits, and services per capita. Based on these rankings, it will score each country on how well it matches, it will rank and recommend the best-fit countries to move to in Eura’s case or expand to in the future in Cara’s case.
