# My Contributions to The Group
For this phase I pulled and cleaned a new API (Public Expenditure on family/children function) that we found from Eurostat because we decided we needed another dataset to support our goals. After cleaning it I proceeded to create two visualizations, one for Eura Pean and one for Cara Day. The one for Eura Pean analyzed the average public cash benefits as a bar chart for family function and aligned with the user story that stated she wanted to look at options for where to move. I then created the visualization for Cara Day, which was a scatterplot looking at the birth rate vs. childcare expenditure per person. This plot aligned with her story that described how she desires to expand her daycare company to other countries. I analyzed both graphs and explained how they related to each persona. Lastly, I assisted in coming up with our proof of concepts for both of the ML models. As a group, we all had parts in revising the user stories to better fit our datasets and how we had to change our project to work more seamlessly. For the blog posts, I uploaded all of my graphs and descriptions and changed my bio.
