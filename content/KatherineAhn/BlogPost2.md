Phase II of the project proved to be more complex than the previous phase last week. This was particularly due to the project moving from a conceptual model to tweaking upon review of the feasibility of our ideas. For this phase, I worked on developing the CareCompass data model wherein for each of the user personas – Gale, a student studying Global Health; Nancy, a policymaker; and Archibald, an individual relocating abroad – a local data model was created to attend to their respective archetype’s needs. For example, the student archetype uses a comparison tool to compare the healthcare systems of 2-3 different countries, however, the policymaker does not necessarily require such. Further, I integrated the three local data models into one composite global data model. I then took the global data model and designed a relational database map based on the relationships I found for our application. Finally, I summarized the relational map and global data model in an initial SQL DDL. This work may be seen here: [ER Diagrams](https://arthur-t-huang.github.io/Care-Compass-Blog/team_posts/phase2post/#er-diagrams). I additionally created several more UI wireframes, particularly for Archibald and one screen for each of Gale and Nancy. As well as this, I also worked to update the project description to align with our current objectives of the application.

The phase II deliverables directly align with the content of CS3200 work we are learning in class. This past week, I learned how to create an ER diagram based on a given scenario, as well as translate such to a relational map. This was a sort of backwards method to understanding the context of relationships from a given relational map into an ER diagram. As such, we still continued to practice building a SQL DDL from relational maps. 

Aside from the project work of the past week, I have continued to explore around Belgium! I have enjoyed learning how to decorate chocolate from a pastry chef of the oldest bakery in Belgium, shopping around Namur, and getting to know some KU Leuven students studying nearby. I look forward to my future adventures, especially as our program travels to Luxembourg this coming week.
