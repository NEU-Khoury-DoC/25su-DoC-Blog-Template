For Phase III, I primarily worked to create and implement the front end pages of our web application, ensuring navigation to different pages was working. Supplemental to that, I translated the ideas of our wireframe onto our web pages so they reflect our designs. I created the Home page, each of the Persona Home pages, the Customize Your Move page for Archibald the relocating resident, the Country Comparator page for Gale the global health student, and finally for Nancy the policymaker – the Features Over Time and Target Scores pages. Further, I personalized our website to look more unique: changing the colors, backdrop, and font. In addition to this, I worked on a couple of routes in the REST API – in particular, the get_all_countries(), as well as the routes for our first machine learning model, the linear regression. While running tests to ensure the functionality of our routes, this was a challenge to say the least. I implemented defined functions to work with the routes; for example, the store_weights route I wrote works to add regression weights from the model to the database through a POST route. On the other hand, the predict_feature_over_time worked to generate a regression prediction for a given feature for a country. This was a GET route, which acted as a bridge between the database and front-end page. As well as this, I organized and completed the API matrix for submission. Finally, I contributed to writing the team blog post and editing our data models from Phase II to satisfy the feedback given earlier; this also included editing our ER diagram, relational database, and SQL DDL. 

The past week since Phase II’s due date was especially enjoyable as our program went to Luxembourg for the weekend. Though a small country, this proved advantageous since we were there for only a short time. I enjoyed going out to eat with my professors, exploring the streets and valleys at night with friends, and going up the LOOK 360° Panorama to see Luxembourg City from spectacular heights!
