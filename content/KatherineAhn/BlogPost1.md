Thus far, the Dialogue has been quite enjoyable! Attempting to take advantage of the good weather while it lasts this week, much of my free time has been spent exploring different parts of Belgium – like roaming the streets of Brussels, trekking to the beautiful city of Bruges, or simply getting some fresh air in Leuven.

Taking CS 3200 with Dr. Fontenot, we have gone over the basics foundations of SQL, and I am excited to see what this translates to in a greater context. We have encountered a variety of speakers from institutions such as NATO and the European Parliament, with lectures and museum visits lined up for the coming week.
