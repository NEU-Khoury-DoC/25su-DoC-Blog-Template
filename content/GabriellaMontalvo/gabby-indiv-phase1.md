# Something Cool I Learned So Far!
An interesting thing I have learned so far during this Dialogue is taking a more holistic view about European innovation and legislation with AI. Gaining insight on this topic was valuable because of how it contrasts with what we know about the rest of the world, particularly in the United States and Asia. The European Union has been clear about their emphasis on ethical considerations, privacy, and regulatory frameworks that demonstrates a proactive approach that will drive the growth of societal impact alongside technological innovation. A strong contrast from this approach are commercially-driven ones seen elsewhere, which broadened my understanding of how different global powers intend on interacting with AI. Overall, being able to be present for these experiences deepened my interest and knowledge of how different regional values influence policy-making.

# Phase 1 Contributions
With regards to the Phase 1 deliverable, it was useful to take this way of considering how regional values impact policy into ultimately narrowing down our focus to how the spending, road quality, and road-related fatalities intersect with each other. When it came to helping and working with my group, I contributed to finding data sources, pulling data from one of the Eurostat sources through an API call, helping develop ideas for user personas, and creating the overall problem statement.
