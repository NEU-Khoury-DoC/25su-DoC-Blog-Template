# Phase 3 Individual Contributions

When working on Phase 3, I was able to make several individual contributions in different aspects throughout. All of us met together after receiving feedback from Phase 2, cohesively discussing what we could each do to make the project better, like adjusting and finalizing certain visualizations, fine-tuning our Machine Learning model ideas, and several group discussions throughout the week on how the models would interact with the user interface.

After discussing as a group, I got to work on what I could individually accomplish to make the project better. I started by adjusting a few visualizations from Phase 2 in the dataset that delt with the number of passenger cars in each country. After looking at feedback, I thought it would be a more interesting insight to observe how the number of passenger cars per capita interact with other features like country and year. A few visualizations were made for that file, which will be updated under the Phase 2 team blog post.

Since we pivoted our idea at the last minute before Phase 2, we did not have the chance to read in, clean, and create visualizations for a key datafile, the number of trips to each country per year. I was tasked with finishing cleaning the data, and creating a meaningful visualization that will hopefully be useful for our National Tourism Official persona in the final product. With more in terms of cleaning, we wanted to re-intergrate the road deaths file from our last idea, so I cleaned that file so we could potentially use it in the future. 

When working with Maria on the Machine Learning model that returns the top 5 recommended countries, we worked past initial challenges like cleaning data and deciding on an appropriate way to rank the countries by our user's preferences. After getting the model working correctly the way we wanted to, we worked on implementing connecting those rankings to a map which would highlight those countries to compensate for not doing analysis on the R-squared score, or splitting into training and testing data since our model is unsupervised. We were successfully able to get close-to-perfected version of the map working on the user interface by communicating with Aidan and Sean about the route, and just need to implement hover data for increased user-interaction for the final phase.

# Fun Program Things

Since Phase 2, lots of fun things happened in the program like taking a weekend trip to Luxembourg! Going to Luxembourg was a very different experience than any city I've ever been in, with a lot of urbanization that was balanced out with getting to experience nature-filled areas like a lake we visited. We made a day trip out of visiting the lake and swam, and then took some nice pictures of the sun beginning to go down a little bit.

In other events, we went to dinner with Dr. Gerber and took a detour through the valley since a marathon was happening. It actually turned out to be a very beautiful walk with great views before ending in a lovely dinner. Thanks, Dr. Gerber!
