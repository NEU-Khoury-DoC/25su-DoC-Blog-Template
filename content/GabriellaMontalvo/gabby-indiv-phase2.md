# Phase 2 Individual Contributions

Phase 2 proved to be a significant challenge not only individually, but for our team as a whole to regroup and surpass the obstacles put in front of us. Rather than focus on the unfortunate aspect of having to redirect our project a bit, we were able to successfully devote our time to making the project into something that could across the board be more feasible, efficient, and exciting for us to work on.

All of us came together and discussed shifting our project to the idea of a European Road Trip Application that can provide useful recommendations for a Road Tripper, economic insight for a National Official, and information on the depreciation of road quality for a Civil Engineering Researcher. After dividing new work and having a solid idea in place, we got to work on our individual contributions.

I was able to contribute to cleaning some of our new data and repurposing our old datasets into the project through new methods of cleaning, creating visualizations to see which features experienced the strongest correlations, and choosing the visualizations that were best fit for the main goals of our project and personas to be submitted in the Phase 2 Deliverable. Moreover, I played a part in helping develop the new idea and refine our final user personas.

# Fun Program Things

Over the past week, I loved getting the opportunity to do some more exploring in the city of Bruges! Getting to see such a historical place being appreciated by people today really reminded me of how places truly are a driving factor of human connection. For more program related activities, I enjoyed broadening my understanding of the ethical intersection of Artificial Intelligence through one of our guest speakers, Kevin Carillon. A topic I really enjoy exploring on my own through individual research is ethics of all kinds, and a recent topic of interest since becoming more invested in data science were its implications in the area of machine learning and automated decision making, so this was a very exciting lecture to have the opportunity to experience!

On another fun note, I’ve been enjoying exploring new places to get coffee and stumbled upon a new favorite today. Absolutely can’t wait to be back and continue making notes of the best places! Ready for Luxembourg this weekend!
