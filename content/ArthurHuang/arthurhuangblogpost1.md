For the first phase of the deliverable, I worked with the group on developing different archetypes and user stories which would best represent the healthcare related use of our project. I also looked to query and retrieve data from the U.N and World Health Organization collection, and ended up sticking with what was gathered from the W.H.O due to complications with the U.N API and accessibility. 

Additionally during our trips to NATO, the EU Parliament, and the EU Commision, it was fascinating to learn about how each organization was structured, as well as seeing the differences between how representatives from each group presented and answered our questions. 

On a more leisurely note, I had lots of fun learning how to decorate pastries with Dr. Fontenot’s friend in Belgium, as well as learning about the history behind the cathedral, concert hall, and market square of Bruges over the weekend.
