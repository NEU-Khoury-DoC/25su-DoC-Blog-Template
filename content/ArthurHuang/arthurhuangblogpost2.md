For the phase two deliverable my primary focus and contribution towards the group was cleaning, organizing, and displaying the data gathered from phase 1, as well as the many additional datasets that were collected throughout the course of phase 2. The majority of cleaned datasets came from the World Health Organization (W.H.O) Datawarehouse, through which I accessed the data through the W.H.O API. Specifically, I gathered a dataset for Generalist medical practitioners, per 10,000 population, Total health expenditure, PPP$ per capita, Live births per 1000 population,  and Catastrophic health spending, all households. The information pulled from each dataset was then cleaned into similarly formatted dataframes, each containing a column for ‘country’, ‘date’, and the attributed numeric value based on what the dataset was measuring. Additionally, I made a line graph for each dataset which graphed the trend of each country in respect to the measured value, throughout the given dates that the dataset spanned. After each dataset was visually displayed, I combined dataframes which had similar formats into one collective dataframe that contained multiple different statistics for each country/date pair. Later into phase 2 I webscrapped the Global Health Security Index for their health assessments for each country, and similarly placed/displayed the data into a dataframe and bar graph that organized the country by health score (highest to lowest). After visualizing data, Anoushaka and I also developed a proof of concept machine learning model by creating a line of best fit and graph and residual plot for the antimicrobal resistance in relation to the healthcare index score (images of the model shown in [Phase II blog post](https://arthur-t-huang.github.io/Care-Compass-Blog/team_posts/phase2post/)).

For DS3000, we learned linear algebra basics such as matrix multiplication and projection which will be helpful in creating our regression models and gradient descent classifications. We also were tested on our ability to use the describe and corr functions to analyse data on our quiz, which is something I later used for my data analysis for this phase, and am planning on using it in further analysis in the future.

On a more leisurely note, my friends and I played lots of pool this week and had lots of fun revisiting the game (even though I’m not very good). We also enjoyed walking the streets of Namur, and would have liked to check out the Citadel if we had more time. On my free day, I made a trip to Antwerp and visited the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, the Antwerp Museum, and the Het Steen which is the oldest building in Belgium.
