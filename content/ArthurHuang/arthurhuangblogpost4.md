For the final phase of this project, the bulk of my time was spent working on creating an autoregressive model for our World of Health Organization datasets, that predict different values a number of years into the future. This model replaces the linear regression model that was developed in phase 3, since a time series model would more accurately account for time which is how all of the W.H.O datasets are measured. I started developing the model in the jupyternotebook using specifically data for Belgium from the expenditure dataset. Using this data, I created an x matrix of lag 10 for the dataset based on the y values of the dataset. After creating the custom x matrix, I then calculated the weights vector using the x matrix and the corresponding y vector. Lastly, I iteratively calculated predicted values by turning the last row of the x matrix into a vector and calculating the dot product of this vector the and the weights vector. This predicted value was then inserted into the front of the lag in the vector, the last value of the vector was dropped, and the process was repeated to find the next predicted value. After fitting the model to an individual country, I then worked to fit the model to the entire dataset. This was done by combining the x_matrix of a country with its corresponding country matrix (a matrix of all zeroes except for one column of all ones that correlates to the given country). Finally, each of these matrices for each country were stacked on top of each other in order to create the x_matrix used for this version of the model, and the same stacking process was done with the y values to create the y_vector. This x_matrix and y_vector were then passed through the same train function to find the weights vector for this model, which was used in the same iterative predicting process from earlier to predict future values for a given country. After this model was able to predict values successfully, I then wrote a route that integrated the model into the features_over_time page and the country_comparator front end page which displayed both the historic and predictive values of a certain dataset for a given country in a graph. The process of designing and implementing the autoregressive model was very challenging and there were many obstacles throughout the process such as misaligned matrices and index out of bound errors which extended the length of the process. However, being able to successfully implement the autoregressive model for three of our W.H.O datasets is very valuable for our web app since it allows us to be able to more accurately predict time series data. I also felt I was able to develop a very strong understanding of how autoregressive models function throughout this process, while also learning better practices when working with matrices, lists, and indexes. Additionally, connecting the model to the front end as well as the database with the stored data was a valuable experience where I learned how to properly write a route and convert/transfer data from the backend to the front end.

Outside of the project, this past week I made a trip to Brussels with Anoushka to visit the Pixar exhibit which was an exciting experience that brought out my inner child. Additionally, I traveled back to Antwerp with a few of my friends and we spent our time biking around the city and buying souvenirs at the shopping center. As this experience begins to come to a close I only further realize how incredibly grateful I am to have come on this trip to Belgium. Thank you to Dr. Gerber and Dr. Fontenot for organizing this dialogue and for all of their work and support both in and outside the classroom throughout this trip. Your guidance has helped me become both a programmer, and a better person, and your humor and compassion helped ease the difficulties of being so far away from home. It is bittersweet leaving this program in a few days, but I am glad to know the memories I made here are ones I will never forget, and I hope to return to Belgium someday soon!
