# My Contributions to Phase 2

## Early Stages

I took a forward role in Phase 2 of the project. In the early stages after Phase 1, I had research further resources from EuroStat. The efforts of which culminated in our third confirmed dataset: public expenditure on family/children function. The addition tackled shortcomings in our previous resources in answering our personas' needs. For example, Ms. Pean, an expecting parent, is expected to be able to leverage her app in choosing a country in the EU that may offer superior child support in the EU as opposed to her home in Poland.

## CS Aspect

With personas refined and sale pitches of our app perfected, I went ahead to create five total diagrams: three localized ER diagrams for each persona, one global ER diagram that combines their needs, and an ERD that incorporates ML data storage models for training and testing models. ER diagrams were crafted using Excalidraw and I used LucidChart to materialize the final ERD diagram.

Beyond ER and ERD, I also implemented the SQL DDL including table creation and mock data insertion. In total, there are 11 tables. The code is available on our Phase 2 blog.

## Bringing it All Together with the Blog

I formatted the blog for the ER, ERD, and SQL DDL aspects. This includes descriptions for each figure. The SQL DDL leveraged HTML formatting to generate a resizable text area for the user's convenience. Behind the scenes, I made finishing touches cleaning the files running this site.
