# Phase 1 Deliverable
Hello! In this first week of dialogue, I've obviously learned a lot in class and on our visits, but I've also learned a suprising amount from walking around Leuven and existing here in general. 

## What I've learned in class
Through this deliverable and while looking for the world bank dataset, I learned how to look out for "good" datasets which were easily accesible, formatted well, and how to distinguish between valid and invalid features. 

## Outside of class
The most interesting thing that I didn't expect to notice/see was the very different ways that our speakers presented themselves and their organizations. I expected all of the speakers to be professional, but I found it interesting how varied they still managed to be while staying professional, and the subtle differences in language that each organization or speaker used. 
More generally, I didn't expect the Leuven folk to be as friendly as they are. We've met a lot of locals who are very nice and have given us a lot of advice/reccomendations in Leuven.
