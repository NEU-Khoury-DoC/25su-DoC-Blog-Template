# Experiences and Lessons  

After two weeks of the DOC, I finally feel like things are settling and I’m getting into a routine. In these past two weeks, I have supposedly learned what I would normally have learned over a month and a half, and I can tell. Something that I would normally practice in labs or homework until I reached understanding, I now have to practice on my own and make sure I truly understand. An example of this is the use of Github. Even though we got a brief explanation of it in class, I still needed to do my own research and checklists when using it and pushing all of my code. 

Even though it has been very stressful lately, especially having to re-start the project 48 hours from having to turn in our phase II deliverables, I have also had a lot of fun. I started to go on runs with my roommate Gabby, where we discovered a castle looking building for the university. I also went with my friends to Bruges where we tried the Brussels waffle, I personally still enjoy the Brussels one better. Overall even though this week has been very stressful, I have enjoyed every part of it.

# Project Contributions 

Since we had to start over with the project, this week was all about figuring out how to work efficiently, both on my own and with my team, to make sure we had Phase I and II ready on time. I spent time helping brainstorm fresh, more focused ideas for our project and also worked on creating user personas. I searched for new datasets and also found ways to adapt some of our old ones so that the work we had already done wouldn’t go to waste.

After we narrowed down our data, I teamed up with Gabby to clean and debug it. We worked on getting everything ready to use in our updated project direction. Once that was done, I dove into building the visualizations. I started learning how to use Plotly to create interactive visuals that could bring our data to life. I experimented with a bunch of different chart types, some I had used before, and others I had to figure out from scratch, to find the ones that made the most sense for our data.ß
