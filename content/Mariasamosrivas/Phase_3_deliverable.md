# Experiences and Lessons  

This past week was a whirlwind. We officially wrapped up DS3000 and took a trip to Luxembourg. Even though Dr. Gerber keeps reminding us that we’ve covered all the course content, it’s still hard to believe we managed to learn an entire semester’s worth of material in just three weeks. It’s been intense, but seeing it all come together in our final project made it feel real.

The trip to Luxembourg came at the perfect time. We visited Eurostat and learned a lot about how they collect and manage data across the EU. What really stood out to me was how seriously they take bias prevention, especially given that most of their data comes from individual countries. It made me think differently about how data is used to shape policy and how much effort goes into making it reliable.

After a fun weekend exploring, it was right back to business with a final test on Tuesday to wrap up DS3000. Once that was out of the way, we dove back into our project work like usual. On a lighter note, I tried white chocolate Oreo ice cream this week, and honestly, it might’ve been the highlight of my week.

# Project Contributions 

With just over a week left before our final presentation, this past week was all about refining our project and getting everything into shape. Gabby and I spent time revisiting our original visualizations and made several adjustments based on the feedback we received from our professor and TA. Their insights were really helpful, and we had some great back-and-forth conversations figuring out how to strengthen our models.

Once the visualizations felt solid, we turned our attention to the machine learning side of things. After meeting with Dr. Gerber, we decided to move forward with a recommendation model where users can input their preferences, like fuel price, road density, and tourism, and get matched with the country that best fits their criteria.

It definitely took a few failed attempts (and a lot of patience), but with Dr. Gerber’s guidance, Gabby and I finally got the model working. Not only could we identify the best-fit country, but we were also able to map it visually, which was a big win. After that, I teamed up with Aidan and Sean to integrate it all into our website. That’s when I started diving deeper into how the wireframes worked and got more comfortable with the structure behind them.
