In Phase I, I focused on writing user stories for two of our key personas: the global health student and the cautious traveler. For the student, I crafted stories that emphasized comparative research, tracking reforms over time, and presenting data visually. For the traveler, I centered the stories around healthcare accessibility, support for chronic conditions, and peace of mind while abroad. 

So far, I’ve had a great time in Belgium, and I think one of the most valuable parts of this Dialogue are the guest speakers. This isn’t like watching an official give a talk online; we’re actively engaging, asking questions, and having real discussions. I especially enjoyed Hélène Pilloud’s insights into NATO’s priorities and Haydn Schofield’s breakdown of how the European Commission actually operates behind the scenes.

CS3200 has also been going decently well. We haven’t had that many sessions yet, but in the time we have, I’ve definitely learned more about SQL and data structures than I expected in such a short span.
