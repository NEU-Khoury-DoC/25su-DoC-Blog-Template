Hi, my name is Max, and I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University! I am studying the Foundations of Data Science and building a cool app called 'Best Life'. I am excited to learn about the role machine learning and AI play in government and international relations and what role I could play in it's development in Europe. Read my "About Max Robinson!" to learn more.
